# Project Documentation

## Overview
This project is a Flask web application managing a dairy business, including farmers, cows, supplies, transactions, and muster data. It leverages SQLAlchemy for database management and Jinja2 templates for the frontend.

## Folder Structure
- **.env**: Contains environment variables, including sensitive data like database URI and API keys.
- **__pycache__**: Holds compiled bytecode files (*.pyc) created by Python to speed up the loading of modules.

## Main Components
- **models/**: Contains the SQLAlchemy models representing the database schema.
- **templates/**: Jinja2 templates for rendering HTML pages.
- **controllers/**: Controller logic to handle user requests and interact with models.
- **forms/**: Contains form definitions (using Flask-WTForms) for the application.
- **run.py**: The entry point to run the Flask application.

### 1. models/
The models/ directory contains SQLAlchemy ORM models that define the structure of the database tables.

- **cow.py**: Represents the Cow model.
- **dairyowner.py**: Represents the DairyOwner model.
- **farmer.py**: Represents the Farmer model, which stores farmer data.
- **farmer_bank.py**: Handles the FarmerBankDetails model, storing farmer banking details.
- **muster_data.py**: Stores the muster data related to farmers and their cows.
- **supplies.py**: Contains the Supplies model.
- **supply_transaction.py**: Represents the SupplyTransaction model, tracking transactions of supplies.
- **transactions.py**: Manages the Transaction model, representing general financial transactions.
- **__init__.py**: Initializes the database with SQLAlchemy.

### 2. controllers/
The controllers/ directory manages the routes and business logic of the application.

- **dairy_owner_controller.py**: Handles routes related to dairy owners.
- **farmer_bank_controller.py**: Manages farmer bank-related routes.
- **farmer_controller.py**: Responsible for handling farmer-related data and views.
- **muster_controller.py**: Manages routes related to muster data.
- **supplies_controller.py**: Handles the logic for managing supplies.
- **supplies_transaction_controller.py**: Manages transactions related to supplies.
- **transaction_controller.py**: Manages general transactions of the dairy business.
- **forms/farmerform.py**: Contains form definitions for farmers.

### 3. templates/
This directory holds the HTML templates used to render pages using Jinja2.

- **admin/**: Placeholder for administrative templates (future implementation).
- **farmers/**: Contains templates for farmer-related pages:
  - **farmer_muster_data.html**: Displays muster data for a specific farmer.
  - **farmer_prof.html**: Renders the profile of a farmer.

### 4. run.py
The run.py file is the entry point to the application. It starts the Flask application and defines configurations, such as the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI and SECRET_KEY.

## Environment Variables (.env)
Environment variables are stored in .env for sensitive configurations, such as:
- **DATABASE_URI**: The URI for connecting to the database.
- **SECRET_KEY**: The secret key for session management.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Setup the Database**: Ensure the database specified in the .env file is running and properly configured.

3. **Run the Flask Application**: Start the Flask app by executing the run.py file:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```
   The application should be up and running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Potential Improvements
- **Error Handling**: More robust error handling could be implemented across routes.
- **Validation**: Additional validation on forms and models could enhance data integrity.
- **Admin Features**: The admin directory could be utilized for a comprehensive administrative panel.
